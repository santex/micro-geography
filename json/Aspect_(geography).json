{"cursor":"6058","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn physical geography, 'aspect' generally refers to the horizontal direction to\nwhich a mountain slope faces. For example, a slope on the eastern edge of the\nRockies toward the Great Plains is described as having an easterly aspect. A\nslope which falls down to a deep valley on its western side and a shallower one\non its eastern side has a westerly aspect or is a west-facing slope. The term\ncan also be used to describe the shape or alignment of a coastline. Here, the\naspect is the direction which the coastline is facing towards the sea. For\nexample, a coastline with sea to the northeast (as in most of Queensland) has a\nnortheasterly aspect.\n\n, a vegetational result of aspect, in evidence in the coastal sage scrub\ncommunity of southern California's Santa Monica Mtns. The slope on the left side\nis north-facing, thus moister and dominated by [[Ceanothus]] sp.. The south-\nfacing slope on the right side is much drier (receiving more direct sun), and is\nmore sparsely vegetated with the more drought tolerant [[Artemisia californica]]\nand [[Yucca whipplei]].]]\n","linknr":144,"url":"Aspect_(geography)","recorded":1362899131,"links":16,"instances":["png","coastal","soil_study","meteorology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical geography"],"headings":["Importance of aspect","Soil aspects","Coastal aspects","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Slope_effect.JPG/200px-Slope_effect.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["precipitation","meteorology"],["zona_da_mata","coastal"],["gulf","png"],["pedology","soil_study"]],"members":["gulf","zona_da_mata","pedology","precipitation"],"related":["Physical_geography","Mountain","Rocky_Mountains","Great_Plains","Valley","Coastline","Queensland","California","Santa_Monica_Mountains","Insolation","Slope","Climate","Microclimate","Sun","West","Tree_line","Australia","Wind","Northern_hemisphere","Evapotranspiration","Swiss_Alps","Agriculture","Himalaya","Glaciated","Glaciology","Precipitation_(meteorology)","Iceland","Organic_matter","Pedogenesis","Windward","Leeward","Aeolian_processes","Soil_life","Tropics","Dahomey_Gap","Coromandel_Coast","Monsoon","Vietnam","Zona_da_Mata_(coastal)","Port_Moresby","New_Guinea","Trade_winds","Gulf_(PNG)","Lae","Pedology_(soil_study)"]}
