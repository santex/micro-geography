The points may be selected for any\nreason, such as gauging stations, river miles, natural features, and topography.\nThey may be arbitrary or vague.

A reach is similar\nto an arm.\n\nThe term \"reach\" can also refer to:\n* An extended portion or stretch of land or water;\n* a straight portion of a stream or river, as from one turn to another;\n* a level stretch, as between locks in a canal;\n* an arm of the sea extending up into the land.\n","linknr":94,"url":"Reach_(geography)","recorded":1362554853,"links":11,"instances":["geography"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Physical geography","Fluvial landforms","Rivers","Water streams","Hydrology"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Edit-copy_purple-wikit.svg/40px-Edit-copy_purple-wikit.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["arm","geography"]],"members":["arm"],"related":["Gauging_station","River_mile","United_States_Geological_Survey","Arm_(geography)","Canal"]}
